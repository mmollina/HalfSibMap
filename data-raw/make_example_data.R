# Generate the small SIMULATED open-pollinated example dataset shipped in
# inst/extdata/ and used by README/examples/tests. Run once from the package root
# (the CSVs are committed; regenerating is only for provenance). Note:
# write_sim_genotypes() reseeds the RNG internally to vary REF/ALT alleles, so the
# REF/ALT letters are not reproducible run-to-run; the 0/1/2 genotype dosages that
# drive the analysis are fully determined by `seed` below.

# A single linkage group of 24 markers at ~5 cM (Haldane) spacing. Every dam is
# heterozygous at every marker, so the phase resolves cleanly and the example yields a
# connected map. (No-linkage intervals and unresolved phase ARE handled by the blockwise
# machinery -- reported as gaps with NA distance -- but this small quick-start dataset is
# deliberately clean; see the block/segment tests for the gap-handling paths.)
